**Load the data, change the names of the variables, and find the linear regression function for the data**
```{r}
df = read.table("/Users/naughtyboy35/Desktop/Stat 615/hw1/maintenance")

cols = c("hours", "copiers")

colnames(df) = cols

fit = lm(hours~copiers,df)
```



**Find the lower and upper bounds for the confidence intervals**
```{r}
new_copiers = seq(0, 10, by=0.1)
fit.CI = predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(copiers=new_copiers), interval="confidence", leve=0.95)
```



**Find the lower and upper bounds for the prediction intervals**
```{r}
fit.PI = predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(copiers=new_copiers), interval="prediction", leve=0.95)

```


**Plot the graph, the confidence interval band and the prediction interval band, color the prediction interval band in green and the confidence interval band in red**
```{r}
plot(df$copiers, df$hours, cex = 1.3, xlab = "Copiers", ylab = "Hours")
abline(fit)
lines(new_copiers, fit.CI[,2], lty=2, col=2)
lines(new_copiers, fit.CI[,3], lty=2, col=2)
lines(new_copiers, fit.PI[,2], lty=3, col=3, lwd=3)
lines(new_copiers, fit.PI[,3], lty=3, col=3, lwd=3)
```

## 1.24(b)


```{r}
anova(fit)
```

**We can see from the ANOVA table, that mean squared error is 79.442, so sigma ^2 = 79.442 **

**Find sigma**

```{r}
sigma = sqrt(79.442)

sigma
```

**sigma = 8.913, the units are the same as standard deviation, which is the number of hours**


## 2.14(a)

**Find the 90% confidence interval**
```{r}
predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(copiers=6),interval = "confidence", leve=0.90)
```

**We are 90% confident that the value of the mean service time falls within the interval of (87.28387, 91.9788).**

## 2.14(b)

```{r}
predict(fit, newdata=data.frame(copiers=6),interval = "prediction", leve=0.90)
```


**Yes, it is wider. Prediction intervals must account for both the uncertainty in knowing the value of the population mean, plus data scatter. So a prediction interval is always wider than a confidence interval.**



## 2.24(b)

**Use summary to find the F-statistic**
```{r}
summary(fit)
```


**Find the f-score**
```{r}
qf(0.90, 1, 43)
```

**We see the F-statistic is greater than the f-score, so we reject H0: There is no linear relationship between the number of copiers and the number of hours, and conclude that there is a linear connection between the two**

##2.24(c)
**When we read it from summary, the multiple R-squared is 0.958, so the total variation would be reduced by 95.8%, it's a large reduction since it's close to 1. It's called the Coefficient of Determination**


##2.24(d)

**Find the r**
```{r}
sqrt(0.9575)
```

**So r = 0.979, and it's positive **
